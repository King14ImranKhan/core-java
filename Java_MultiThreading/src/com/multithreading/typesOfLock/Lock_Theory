Object level Lock(Instance Lock)
This is the mechanism when we want to synchronize the non-static method or non-static code 
block such that only one thread will be able to execute the code block on given instance of the 
class.
Object level lock should alwayz be done to make instance level data Thread safe. 

Class Level Lock
Class Level Lock prevents multiple threads to enter in synchronized block in any of all the 
available instances of the class on run time.
Example : If the runtime has 100 instances of the class then only one thread will be able to 
execute the synchronized method in any of the instance at a time and all other instances will 
be locked for other threads.
This class level lock should always be done to make static data thread safe.
It is possible that both static synchronized and non-static synchronized method can run 
simultaneously because they acquire the different locks.
