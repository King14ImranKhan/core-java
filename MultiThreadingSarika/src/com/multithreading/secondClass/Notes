Java Thread Pool
Java thread pool represents a group of worker thread that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.
In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size threads are created. A thread from thread pool is pulled 
out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, thread is contained in the
thread pool again.

Advantages of Java Thread Pool
Better performance, it saves time because there is no need to create new thread.

Executor Service
Java 5 introduced a high-level API for concurrency, most of it implemented in the java.util.concurrent package.
One of the features of this API is the Executor interfaces that provide an alternative(better) way to launch 
and manage threads.



Executor
This interface has the execute() method, which is designed to replace:
Runnable r = ...
Thread t = new Thread(r);
t.start();

With:

Runnable r = ...
Executor e = ...
e.execute(r); 

*ExecutorService
This interface extends Executor to provide more features, like the submit() method that accepts Runnable and 
Callable objects and allows them to return a value.

*ScheduledExecutorService
This interface extends ExecutorService to execute tasks at repeated intervals or with a particular delay.
